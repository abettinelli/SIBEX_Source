 -Description: 
 1. This method is to apply an appropriate spatial spherical mean convolution filter to the image 
 2. Filtered image is passed into IBSI_LocalIntensityFeatures_Feature.m to compute the related features.
 
 -Parameters:
 1. Radius: the Radius of the sphere centered on the maximum intensity voxel
 
 -Revision:
