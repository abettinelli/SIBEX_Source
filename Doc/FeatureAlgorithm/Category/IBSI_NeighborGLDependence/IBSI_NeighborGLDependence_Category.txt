 -Description: 
 1. This method is to compute neighbouring grey level dependence based features (NGLDM) from image inside
    the binary mask.
 2. NGLDM is passed into IBSI_NeighborGLDependence_Feature.m to compute the related features.
 
 -Parameters:
 1. AggregationMethod:
	1: 2D:avg 	averaged over slices.
	2: 2D:mrg	merged over all slices.             (rare)
	3: 3        calculated from single 3D matrix.   (default)
 2. Rescale: 
	'fbn': fixed bin number -> specify BinNumber.
	'fbs': fixed bin size   -> specify BinSize.
	'off': do not perform the discretization step.
 3. BinNumber: Integer specifying the number of bin number to use when scaling the grayscale values. [] when rescale is set to 'fbs' or 'off'.
 4. BinSize: Integer specifying the bin size to use when scaling the grayscale values. [] when rescale is set to 'fbn' or 'off'.
 5. Alpha: Non-negative integer coarseness parameter. (default 0)
 6. NHood: The neighborhood matrix size in X dimension.
 7. NHoodSym:      
	1: neighborhood matrix size in Y and Z are calculated to best match neighborhood physical length in X dimension.
	0: neighborhood matrx size are same in X, Y, and Z dimensions.
 8. IncludeEdge:
	1: include edge pixels for analysis.
	0: do not include edge pixels for analysis.
