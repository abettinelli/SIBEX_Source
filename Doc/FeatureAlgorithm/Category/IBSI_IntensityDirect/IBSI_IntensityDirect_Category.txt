 -Description: 
 1. This method is to preprocess the binary mask for the features derived directly from the image intensity.
    The binary mask can be modified through the intensity thresholding.
 2. Image and binary mask are passed into IBSI_IntensityDirect_Feature.m to compute the related features.
