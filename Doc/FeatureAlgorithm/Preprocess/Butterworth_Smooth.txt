-Description: 
Applies a 2D Butterworth filter in the frequency domain slice-by-slice.

 Based on text Digital Imaging Processing by Gonzales and Woods.
 
-Parameters:
1.  cutoff: Frequencies below radius cutoff will be filtered. Smaller
               number produce more smoothing in the spatial domain.
2.  order: higher orders produce harder cuts at the cutoff frequency.

-Revision:
2015-10-30: The method is implemented.
