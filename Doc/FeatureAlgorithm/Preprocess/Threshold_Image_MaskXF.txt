-Description: 
This method modifies the image and mask by applying an image intensity
threshold and 2D binary mask erosion. After applying the image intensity
threshold it uses the MatLab 'imfill' function to recover pixels whose
intensities are below the threshold value but are surrounded by pixels
above the threshold in all nine 2D directions. This allows for the
inclusion of low density areas within the tumor while excluding any
surrounding areas of air that shouldn't be included in the ROI. 

-Parameters:
1. ThresholdLow:   Lower threshold of image intensity.
2. ThresholdHigh:  Upper threshold of image intensity.
3. ErosionDist:    Distance in mm for binary mask erosion.

-Revision:
2014-06-21: The method is implemented.
