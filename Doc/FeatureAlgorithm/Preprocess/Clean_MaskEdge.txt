-Description: 
This method is to remove edge voxels of binary mask based on the fraction of edge voxel.
To get the fraction, binary mask is first generated into the finer resolution, cacluate the fraction,  then go back to the original resolution.

-Parameters: 
1. EdgeVoxFraction: The Threshold to remove or keep edge voxels
2. XPix_ScaleFactor: Scale Factor of pixel size in X dimension. 
3. YPix_ScaleFactor: Scale Factor of pixel size in Y dimension.
4. ZPix_ScaleFactor: Scale Factor of pixel size in Z dimension.

-Formula:
1.  Down-Sample: Pix_ScaleFactor > 1; Up-Sample: Pix_ScaleFactor < 1. 
     PixSizeAfter=PixSizeCurrent*Pix_ScaleFactor.
2.  Trilinear interpolation is used.

-Revision:
2014-09-09: The method is implemented.
