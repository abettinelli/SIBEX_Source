-Note:
In the test review window, the original image is also resampled accordingly.

-Description: 
This method is to up-sample or down-sample image in 3D.  The core code is in C++.

-Parameters: 
1. XPix_ScaleFactor: Scale Factor of pixel size in X dimension. 
2. YPix_ScaleFactor: Scale Factor of pixel size in Y dimension.
3. ZPix_ScaleFactor: Scale Factor of pixel size in Z dimension.

-Formula:
1.  Down-Sample: Pix_ScaleFactor > 1; Up-Sample: Pix_ScaleFactor < 1. 
     PixSizeAfter=PixSizeCurrent*Pix_ScaleFactor.
2.  Trilinear interpolation is used.

-Revision:
2014-06-04: The method is implemented.
