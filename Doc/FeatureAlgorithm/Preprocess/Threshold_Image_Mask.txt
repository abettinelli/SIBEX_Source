-Description: 
This method is to modify image and mask by applying image intensity threshold and 2D binary mask erosion.

-Parameters:
1. ThresholdLow:   Lower threshold of image intensity.
2. ThresholdHigh:  Upper threshold of image intensity.
3. ErosionDist:    Distance in mm for binary mask erosion.

-Revision:
2014-02-06: The method is implemented.
