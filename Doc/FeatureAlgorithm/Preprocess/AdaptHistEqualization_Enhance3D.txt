-Description: 
This method is to perform adaptive histogram equalization in 3D. The core code is in C++.

-Parameters:
1.  NumTiles:  The number of voxels in the tile X dimension. The method automatically computes
                  the number of voxels in Y and Z dimensions to match the physical length in X dimension.

-Revision:
