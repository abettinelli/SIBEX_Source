-Description: 
 Consider intensity range between mean +/- 3*sigma.
 Outside the range[u-3sigma, u+3sigma] were not considered

-Parameters:
Sigma: Range with std: n=3 (default)
BitDepth: Quantized to 8 bit: BitDepth = 8 (default)

-Reference:
Collewet et. al. 2003, Influence of MRI acquisition protocols and image intensity normalization methods on texture classification

-Revision:
2017-03-10: The method is implemented.
