-Purpose: 
ROIs are exported into Matlab format.

-Format Description:
1.  Variable 'structAxialROI':  contains the curve information of each ROI. Its data type  is structure. 
     It has fields describing ROI name, 2D ROI curve's coordinates, curve's slice location.
2.  Variable 'BWMatInfo':  contains the binary mask information of each ROI. Its data type  is structure. 
    It has fields describing the raw data of binary mask, binary mask's start point, its dimension, and its voxel size.
3. Variable 'PatInfo': contains the last name, the first name, and the MRN of the patient. 


-Revision:
