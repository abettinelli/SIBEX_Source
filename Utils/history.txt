version 1.7.5 (10/07/2009)

* Fixed a bug in reading Pinnacle ROI file. For Pinnacle version 8.0m when the mesh
  header is not presented, the previous version will not be able to load in the 
  data successfully.
* Fixed a bug in generating 3d mesh from 2d contours. In previous version, when the
  intersection of some axes exactly falls on some points in the contours' point
  list, there will be a cut-off gap separating the whole ROI structure.
  
  
  
version 1.7.2 (09/25/2009)

* Updated parallel processing and added exception handling in parallel processing 
  on the contour deformation and generating sagittal and coronal contours.
  
  
  
version 1.7.1 (09/25/2009)

* Fixed a bug in 2d contour processing which may cause the program crash when there
  is only one slice in the reference ROI contours.
* Fixed a bug in the generated sagittal and coronal contours. In some slices, the 
  contours are missing, which is caused by two very similar contours generated in 
  the resulting axial contours.
* Added basic exception processing when performing contour deformation, contour
  reformatting, and generating sagittal and coronal contours.


  
version 1.7.0 (09/22/2009)

* Fixed a bug in mesh warping that might cause out-of-boundary issue. The points in
  3d mesh to be deformed may be out of the boundary of deformation field so that no
  displacement vector can be applied to them. Revised the warping algorithm by 
  trilinearly interpolating the deformation vectors to resolve this problem. 
* Revised the program to be 64 bit compatible. The program right now can be compiled
  on both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows operating systems.
* Revised the spacing and orgin from single precision floating values to double 
  precision floating values.
* Changed the ITK library to be version 3.16.0 and the VTK library to be version
  5.4.2. The ITK library should be compiled with ITK_USE_CENTERED_PIXEL_COORDINATES_
  CONSISTENTLY option ON.
  
  
  
version 1.6.2 (09/11/2009)

* Fixed a bug in cutting 3d surface to generate 2d contours, which is caused by the
  precision of float points.
* Fixed a bug in 2d contour processing, which may result in missing contours when a 
  ring structure presents.
  
  
  
version 1.6.1 (09/10/2009)

* Added an interface function to load Pinnacle ROIs from a file (plan.roi). The output
  is a structure which will be used in CAT (MATLAB) via a MEX function. The ROI file
  of all three directions (axial, sagittal, coronal) can be loaded via this function:
  
  void ReadPinnacleROIFile(std::vector<PinnacleROIStruct> & roiStructArray, //output ROI structure list 
                           const std::string & roiFileName,                 //input ROI file name
                           PinnacleROIType roiType,                         //direction (axial, sagittal, coronal)
                           const double DXYStart[2]);                       //internal start point defined in CAT
                           
  MEX function will convert the output roiStructArray to be of MATLAB data structure.
  
  
  
version 1.6.0 (09/04/2009)

* Modified the source for parallel processing the contour warping - requires boost
  library version 1.38 (http://www.boostpro.com/download/boost_1_38_setup.exe)
* Added precompiled header to speed up the project building (in CMakeLists.txt)
* Added Windows resource file to the library. A version tag is inserted into the
  ContourWarping.dll, which can be viewed by right clicking the file and selecting
  "properties".
* Fixed a bug in 2d contour processing the boundary slices.


  
version 1.5.2 (09/01/2009)

* Note: require install update of Visual C++ 2005 Redistributible. Compiled runtime
  library depends on WER.dll and IESHIMS.dll which are included in the update

  ec73-40ff-b072-9112bab119c2
  Download vcredist_x86.exe and install it on local computer to resolve depency problem.



version 1.5.1 (08/24/2009)

* Fixed a bug in generating curves in sagittal and coronal planes. Different flag value is
  set for sagittal or coronal curves so that they can be displayed correctly in Pinnacle.



version 1.5.0 (08/19/2009)

* Revised the adaptive smoothing mechanism for 2d contours to make the smoothing a little
  bit aggressive for middle size (in the sense of curve area) curves
* In 2d contour processing, added additional check to prevent from removing too many 
  boundary slices in the case of the slice number of deformed ROI is equal or less than
  that of reference ROI.
* In 2d contour processing, added a function to prevent from removing curves in transitional
  slices - which means two neighboring slice curve areas of the reference ROI have a 
  large change.
* In 2d contour processing, considered the case that one slice contains no curves. No curve
  similarity checking when going through those slices, including reference checking and 
  neighboring checking.
* In 2d contour processing, added function to check curves in a same slice and remove the 
  smaller one of two very similar curves.
* In 2d contour processing, revised the curve similarity computation for neighboring curve
  similarity and in slice curve similarity.                    
* Made the cutted 2d contours closed in both contour deformation (in CAT) and contour
  reformatting (in IGRTUtilies).
   

   
version 1.4.0 (08/14/2009)

* Fixed a bug in tracking 2d contours after cutting them from 3d surface.
* Reduced the computation time for cutting 3d surface to 2d contours to be around 1/3 of
  that in previous version.
* Reduced the computation time for processing 2d contours to be around 1/2 of that in
  previsous version.
* Revised the 2d contour to 3d mesh conversion algorithm to adaptively reduce the bumpy
  effect on 3d surface in between slices, and keep the surface rendering reasonably good.
* Implemented interface functions for computing contours in sagittal and coronal planes.
  The external call to these functions are
  
  void GenerateXYDirectionROIs(const char * axialROIFileName,          // Pinnacle ROI file (input, in axial plane)
                               const char * roiName,                   // ROI name
                               const char * imgHeaderFileName,         // Image header file corresponding to ROI file
                               const char * sagittalROIFileName,       // Pinnacle ROI file (output, in sagittal plane)
                               const char * coronalROIFileName,        // Pinnacle ROI file (output, in coronal plane)
                               const bool bPerformSmoothing = false);  // Switch to perform 3d mesh smoothing

  void GenerateXYDirectionROIs(const char * axialROIFileName,
                               const char * imgHeaderFileName,
                               const char * sagittalROIFileName, //X
                               const char * coronalROIFileName,  //Y
                               const bool bPerformSmoothing = false);
                                    
  Mex function calling the second one to provide interface to CAT is implemented in 
  ComputeXYCurves.dll. This function will be used to generate curves in sagittal and 
  coronal planes for display in CAT.
  
  
  
version 1.3.0 (07/29/2009)

* Implemented interface functions for parallel processing. The following functions haved
  been added in the compiled ContourWarping.dll -
    a) ReadPinnacleROIs(): read ROIs from a pinnacle file
    b) DeformPinnacleROI(): warp one ROI
    c) WritePinnacleROIs(): write ROIs to a pinnacle file
    d) QueryPointerSize(): obtain the size for allocating memory to pointers outside
    e) ReadDeformationField(): read in deformation field from file
    f) BuildTablePosition(): build a vector of table position
    g) ReleaseItkSmartPointerMemory(): release ITK smart pointer memory
  Refer to parallel_example.cpp for detailed usage.



version 1.2.1 (07/28/2009)

* Fixed a bug in constructing 3d surface from 2d poly contours. Float point round-off issue
  may cause the 3d suface being cutted off due to lost of one slice at the boundary of slice
  with z value = 0.
* Fixed a bug in cutting 3d surface to 2d poly contours after deformation. All cells in 2d
  cutting plane that are not line type should be removed from tracking the poly contours.
* Added slice region boundary to deformed contours to avoid error in the later curve display
  in CAT.


  
version 1.2.0 (07/20/2009)

* Incorporated the mesh part in IGRTUtils for updating plan.roi in the case of rotation and 
  slice spacing change. The interface to IGRTUtils is in file CTRotation_Joy.m.
* Fixed a bug in reading image header to acquire image size, spacing, starting point for
  the initialization of class PinnacleROIConvert.
* Fixed a bug in reading plan.roi file in the case there are empty curves (no point list but 
  with a curve header in the file).
* Fixed a bug in converting 3d surface to 2d slice contours. There are missing curves on some
  slices due to a bug in preprocessing the 2d contour for tracking a point-ordered curve.
* Improved the 2d contour point tracking algorithm for the case that two enclosed curves share
  a piece of common edges.
* Fixed a bug in clipping 2d contours when the deformation region box is smaller than the 
  curves of some object. Used integer instead of float for comparison to avoid discarding
  curves on boundary slices.
* Revised the 2d contour to 3d mesh conversion algorithm to make sure the boundary slices will
  not be discard, and rotation in IGRTUtils will not generate a zigzag contour shape when the 
  rotation angle is large.
* Reduced the memory usage when performing deformation or reformatting in class 
  PinnacleROIConvert.



version 1.1.0 (07/06/2009)

* Adaptive contour smoothing ¨C smoothing of contours will self-adjust according to the 
  enclosed contour area. The smaller contour area, the less aggressive smoothing performed.
* Fixed a bug in logical contour processing which might cause the CAT crashing. It's caused 
  by the index exceeding vector bound due to a very small number of slices in a ROI.
* Fix a bug that made the program unable to locate the image header file required for mesh 
  processing when the entire data set is copied from another computer. This file
  UtilsMeshDeformROI.m is updated to resolve this problem.
* Refined the logical contour processing to remove small islands and holes.



version 1.0.0 (06/30/2009)

* Incorporated the mesh part into CAT for contour deformation following image registration.
  The interface to CAT is in file Alignment.m, AlignmentSmall.m, and UtilsMeshDeformROI.m.
* Developed the mesh utility using C++, along with ITK and VTK. Output is a shared dynamic
  library (*.dll) file called by mex functions, which provide the interface to main CAT
  program running on MATLAB.
* List of functionalities and corresponding C++ classes of the mesh utility -
